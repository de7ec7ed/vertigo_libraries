Naming Convention
All functions, defines, structures, unions, typedefs and global variables should have the filename
they are located in appended to the beginning of their name (ex. readme_function) followed by an
underscore.

Calling Convention

C Functions - Should always return SUCCESS or FAILURE with a type of result_t
unless the function can not fail. No overloaded variables are allowed, such as
returning NULL for a virtual address on failure. Any parameter that is larger
than size_t should be passed as a pointer.

Assembly Functions - Should always return a variable in through r0 or NULL. These functions
can support overloaded returns such as NULL or a virtual address. In general assembly
functions should be minimized to getters and setters when possible.
